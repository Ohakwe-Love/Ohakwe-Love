# Hi, I'm Ohakwe Love

> *"Code is like poetry â€” and I'm learning to write verses that solve real-world problems."*

Iâ€™m a **Full-Stack Web Developer** from Nigeria with a big dream and an even bigger work ethic. I didn't come from a formal tech background, but with consistent effort, a curious mind, and a hunger to create, I've learnt the skills to build web apps that actually **work and wow**.

Iâ€™m most inspired by **Mark Zuckerberg**, but how he started small but kept building with vision. I believe in learning fast, starting scrappy, and growing big.
